Is the movie industry dying? is Netflix the new entertainment king? Those were the first questions that lead me to create a dataset focused on movie revenue and analyze it over the last decades. But, why stop there? There are more factors that intervene in this kind of thing, like actors, genres, user ratings and more. And now, anyone with experience (you) can ask specific questions about the movie industry, and get answers.

Steven Spielberg wants to produce a new movie for the summer, and hired you to help him understand the characteristics of the movies in the last 30 years, for an informed decision regarding the genre, director, etc.

My objective is to help him find the most suitable genre, director, star, writer and rating, based on the score and profit.
Finally, based on the trends of different genre, i will look for a proper genre that has the greatest potential business values and fitting the trends of genre.
